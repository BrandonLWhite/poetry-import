# Since this is a library, and not an application/lambda, we express the dependencies in requirements.txt
# using PEP-440 "compatible version" syntax.  Likewise, there is no lock file for a library. That is left up to the
# integrating application.  Our job here is to express only what is needed by the library and to be as flexible as
# possible.
